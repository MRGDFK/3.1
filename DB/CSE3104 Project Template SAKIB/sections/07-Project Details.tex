\section{Project Details}
The "Airlines Ticketing System" project comprises several key components that collectively make it a robust and efficient solution for the airline industry. These components include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Database Development:} The project involves designing and implementing a relational database that stores information related to flights, passengers, reservations, and airline staff. This database forms the core of the system.

    \item \textbf{User Interface:} A user-friendly web-based front-end is developed to provide passengers with an intuitive platform for searching and booking flights. The interface also enables airline staff to manage flight schedules, reservations, and passenger data.

    \item \textbf{Payment Gateway Integration:} The system integrates with payment gateways to facilitate secure online transactions, allowing passengers to complete reservations and payments efficiently.

    \item \textbf{Reporting and Analytics:} To support airlines in monitoring their operations, the project includes a reporting and analytics feature. This component allows airlines to generate reports on revenue, flight occupancy, and passenger statistics.

\end{itemize}

The collaborative efforts of the development team and stakeholders ensure that these project components are successfully integrated to create a comprehensive and effective "Airlines Ticketing System."
